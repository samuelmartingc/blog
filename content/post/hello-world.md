Welcome to my new blog, I’m Samuel Martín [@samuelmartingc].
I want to share my knowledge and opinions with the world, trying to improve it, and be improved by it.
I will write about IT, but also I want to share with you my opinions about almost everything.
English is not my main language, but I will try to do my best.

> Once again… welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring.
